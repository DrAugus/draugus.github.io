Different Soundscapes can result in Elemental Skills and Bursts to produce various effects, and decrease nearby opponents' corresponding Elemental RES while active. ◇ After unleashing her Elemental Skill, Xilonen will enter the Nightsoul's Blessing state and switch to the Blade Roller mode. While in this mode, Xilonen's Normal Attacks will allow her to perform consecutive kicks using her roller blades. She can also engage in swift movement and climbing, and activate her Geo Samplers. After unlocking the Talent \"Netotiliztli's Echoes,\" different Soundscapes will enhance Xilonen's Normal and Plunging Attacks: either by gaining Nightsoul points upon hitting enemies or by increasing the DMG dealt by Normal and Plunging Attacks. When Nightsoul points reach the maximum, all Samplers will be activated. ◆ Elemental Burst: Ocelotlicue Point! ◇ Deals AoE Geo DMG to opponents and based on different Soundscapes: Restores HP for nearby active characters or deals additional AoE Geo DMG.

When this effect reaches 2 stacks or the 2nd stack's duration is refreshed, increase all nearby party members' All Elemental DMG Bonus by 8% for every 1,000 DEF the equipping character has, up to a maximum of 25.6%, for 15s. ◆ During the event wish \"Epitome Invocation,\" the event-exclusive 5-star weapon Peak Patrol Song (Sword) will receive a huge drop-rate boost! Sturdy Bone (4-Star Sword) Sprint or Alternate Sprint Stamina Consumption decreased by 15%. Additionally, after using Sprint or Alternate Sprint, Normal Attack DMG is increased by 16% of ATK. This effect expires after triggering 18 times or 7s. ◆ During the event wish \"Epitome Invocation,\" the event-exclusive 4-star weapon Sturdy Bone (Sword) will receive a huge drop-rate boost! Mountain-Bracing Bolt (4-Star Polearm) Decreases Climbing Stamina Consumption by 15% and increases Elemental Skill DMG by 12%. Also, after other nearby party members use Elemental Skills, the equipping character's Elemental Skill DMG will also increase by 12% for 8s. ◆ During the event wish \"Epitome Invocation,\" the event-exclusive 4-star weapon Mountain-Bracing Bolt (Polearm) will receive a huge drop-rate boost!
